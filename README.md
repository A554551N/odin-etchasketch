# Etch-A-Sketch
*Project odin-etchasketch*
The Odin Etch-A-Sketch project will demonstrate competency in the use of DOM manipulation and Events in Javascript.  
The tool will:
- Create a square grid of DIV elements inside of a container 960px wide.
- When a mouse enters any grid square, the color of the grid will change allowing for simple drawings.
- Have a button that allows a user to clear and change the size of the grid.
